    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        Founded by three childhood friends, SaunaGuus was born from a passion for transforming
        harsh, dark winters into moments of warmth, connection, and renewal.
        <br><br>
        In Denmark, we’ve always had the sauna — a place to warm the body and clear the mind.
        But it wasn’t until we discovered the power of sharing that experience in community that
        everything changed.
        <br><br>
        Over the last seven years we’ve facilitated more than 800 sessions for nearly 20,000 people
        — guiding them into heat, breath, and renewal. With each gathering, our belief in the ritual
        only deepened.
        <br><br>
        Cold days no longer kept us apart; they drew us together. As the days grew colder and
        shorter, winter transformed from isolation into celebration.
        <br><br>
        Through SaunaGuus, we now look forward to the cold — even in the darkest months.

      <p>OUR SPARK</p>
    </div>

    <div class="spark-text">
      <p>
        SaunaGuus was born from a simple belief: that the ritual of saunagus shouldn’t be reserved for the few, but
        shared with everyone.
        <br><br>
        In the Scandinavian tradition, saunagus has always been about more than heat. It is rooted in
        centuries of culture and community — not the trappings of white robes, exclusive
        memberships, or unaffordable day passes. Here, the practice is shaped by authenticity, not by
        borrowed notions of luxury.
        <br><br>
        Our mission is to share this tradition openly and honestly — whether you are an athlete, a
        student, or simply someone in need of a reset. Everyone can enter, everyone can belong.
        SaunaGuus is not a club — it’s a sanctuary. A place where heat, cold, and scent meet
        presence and attention. A place where you don’t need to prove anything, perform, or follow a
        trend. Whether it’s your first session or your hundredth, you’ll find space to slow down and
        reconnect — stripped of noise, stripped of demand.

        In a world that demands constant motion, SaunaGuus carves out a space for complete
        <br>
        composure — a space to disconnect from demands and reconnect with yourself.
        <br><br>
        At SaunaGuus, we offer something rooted in centuries of Scandinavian tradition: the ritual
        of saunagus. Through heat, essential oils, breathwork, and cold exposure, we guide you into release —
        physically, mentally, and emotionally.
        <br><br>
        This is not about performance.
        <br>
        It’s about presence.
        <br><br>
        Each session is an invitation to stop pushing, to soften, and to feel. Not a test of strength, but
        an act of presence. Within the rising heat and biting cold, you’re forced into a
        parasympathetic reset: tension breaks, the mind steadies, and resilience forms.
        <br><br>
        This is where recovery becomes ritual.
        <br>
        Where wellness is not a luxury, but a rhythm.
        <br><br>
        Whether you come after a hard run, a long week, or simply to pause and draw breath —
        you’ll find a space that welcomes your pace, your level, and your intention. Here, everyone
        has shelter to return to themselves.
        <br><br>
        At the height of heat, noise burns off, pressure evaporates — and in that clearing, something shifts.
        <br><br>
        Born from Scandinavian tradition.
        <br>
        A ritual that transformed us — for the better.
        <br>
        We’re here to share it with you.
